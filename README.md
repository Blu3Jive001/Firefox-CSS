# Firefox-CSS

This repository holds my custom css for Firefox and other websites (with the stylus extension). This code is not 100% mine. Some of it came from JavaCafe01 and other bits from MrotherGuy.

My css is messy, if you find a problem and figure out how to improve my code, please do!

## Setup

### Firefox css

[This article](https://www.howtogeek.com/334716/how-to-customize-firefoxs-user-interface-with-userchrome.css/) provides a good overview about how you figure out where you have to move the files for modifying firefox.

You should also set Firefox to "compact" and "dark mode". Those two options are available under menu > customize.

### Stylus

Install the [stylus firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/).
After that copy & paste the contents of the files in the stylesheets folder over into your extension settings.
